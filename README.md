description: In this tutorial, you will about how you can build an ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) pipeline for batch processing using [Amazon EMR (Amazon Elastic MapReduce)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-what-is-emr.html) and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). During this process we will also learn about few of the use case of batch ETL process and how EMR can be leveraged to solve such problems. 

Batch ETL is a common use case across many organizations and this use case implementation learning will provide you with a starting point, using which you can build more complex data pipelines in AWS using Amazon EMR.

We are going to use [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) to interact with the Spark cluster. PySpark allows you to write Spark applications using Python APIs.

# Creating an ETL Pipeline with Amazon EMR and Apache Spark

In this tutorial, you will about how you can build an ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) pipeline for batch processing using [Amazon EMR (Amazon Elastic MapReduce)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-what-is-emr.html) and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). During this process we will also learn about few of the use case of batch ETL process and how EMR can be leveraged to solve such problems. 

Batch ETL is a common use case across many organizations and this use case implementation learning will provide you with a starting point, using which you can build more complex data pipelines in AWS using Amazon EMR.

We are going to use [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) to interact with the Spark cluster. PySpark allows you to write Spark applications using Python APIs. 

## Use case and problem statement

For this tutorial, let's assume you have a vendor who provides incremental sales data at the end of every month. And the file arrives in S3 as `CSV` and it needs to be processed and made available to your data analysts for querying and analysis. 

We need to build a data pipeline such that it will take this new sales file from the S3 bucket, processes it with required transformations using Amazon EMR, and would save the cleaned and transformed data into the target S3 bucket, which will be used later on for querying. 


## Architecture 

To implement this data pipeline, we will use EMR cluster with Spark as the distributed processing engine. And we are going to use Amazon S3 for storing the:
    - `RAW` data (which is the input and unprocessed data) and 
    - `CLEANSED` data (which is output and processed data)

![Img Architecture](img/Architecture.png)

## Create an EMR Cluster

Before we create an EMR cluster we need to create a `Key Pair`, which we would need to access the EMR cluster's master node later on. So, lets create that first, 

1. Login to your AWS account and navigate to the EC2 console, and click on **Key Pairs** option on the left menu bar. And then, click on `Create Key Pair` 

![Key Pair 1](img/key_pair.png)

2. Provide a name (`mykey-emr`) for your key pair and click on `Create Key Pair`. 

![Key Pair 2](img/key_pair_2.png)

3. Now, we can go ahead and create an `Amazon EMR cluster`. For that navigate to Amazon EMR in the console and click on **Create Cluster** to create an EMR cluster

![emr cluster 1](img/emr_1.png)

4. Provide some `Cluster name` to your EMR cluster, and select the following:
    - Select the **latest release** of EMR under **Software configuration** section
    - Select **Spark: Spark 3.3.0 on Hadoop 3.2.1 YARN with and Zeppelin 0.10.1** under **Application** section, 
    - Select the right **EC2 key pair** (which you created in the previous step) under the **Security and access** section 

   Keep everything else as default and click on **Create cluster** 

![emr cluster 2](img/emr_2.png)

5. Cluster creation would take some time, and after couple of minutes, you will see that the cluster is **up and running** with a state as `Waiting` (which means the cluster is now ready and waiting to execute any ETL job)

![emr cluster 3](img/emr_3.png)

## Create an Amazon S3 bucket

Now we will create an Amazon S3 bucket and shall create two sub-folders within that, which will be used for store `RAW` and `CLEANSED` data

1. Navigate to the Amazon S3 console and click on **Create Bucket** 

![S3_1](img/s3_1.png)

2. Create a **bucket** (e.g. `etl-batch-emr-demo`) 

![S3_2](img/s3_2.png)

3. Once the bucket is created, create two sub-folders namely 
    - `cleaned_data` 
    - `raw_data`

![S3_3](img/s3_3.png)

4. Upload the [sales dataset](/dataset/SalesData.csv) in the bucket under the folder `raw_data`

![Upload raw data](img/upload_csv.png)

## Submit the PySpark job 

Now, that we have the dataset uploaded in S3, its time to submit the PySpark job from our EMR cluster. 

1. Navigate to the EMR console, select the `EMR cluster` which you created in earlier and click on **Connect to the Master Node Using SSH** 

![emr_4](img/emr_4.png)

2. SSH to the EMR cluster's Master node from your terminal 

3. Copy the PySpark code [`etl-job.py`](/emr-etl-job.py) and save it in the `Master Node` and make the following changes and save the file:

    - `S3_INPUT_DATA`  = '<YOUR_BUCKET_LOCATION_OF_RAW_DATA>'
    - `S3_OUTPUT_DATA` = '<YOUR_BUCKET_LOCATION_OF_CLEANED_DATA>'

```python

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

S3_INPUT_DATA = '<YOUR_BUCKET_LOCATION_OF_RAW_DATA>'
S3_OUTPUT_DATA = '<YOUR_BUCKET_LOCATION_OF_CLEANED_DATA>'

def main():

    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("My Demo ETL App").getOrCreate()
    spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel('ERROR')

    # Spark Dataframe (Raw)- Transformation 
    df = spark.read.option("Header", True).option("InferSchema", True).csv(S3_INPUT_DATA)
    
    replacements = {c:c.replace(' ','_') for c in df.columns if ' ' in c}
    final_df = df.select([F.col(c).alias(replacements.get(c, c)) for c in df.columns])

    print(f"Total no. of records in the source data set is : {final_df.count()}")

try:
    final_df.write.mode('overwrite').parquet(S3_OUTPUT_DATA)
    print('The cleaned data is uploaded')
except:
    print('Something went wrong, please check the logs :P')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

4. Submit the `PySpark job`

```bash
sudo spark-submit etl-job.py 
```

5. Once the job **completes**, check the S3 bucket under the folder `cleaned_data`, you will see the new transformed and processed data in `parquet` format 

![s3 cleaned data](img/s3_cleaned_data.png)

## Validating the output using Amazon Athena

Now, the `cleansed` data is available in Amazon S3 in the form of `parquet` format, but to make it more consumable for data analysts or data scientists, and it would be great if we could enable querying the data through SQL by making it available as a database table.

To make that integration, we can follow a two-step approach:
1. We need to run the Glue crawler to create a AWS Glue Data Catalog table on top of the S3 data.
2. Once that is done, we can run a query in Amazon Athena to validate the output

### Creating an AWS Glue Data Catalog

1. Navigate to the AWS Glue crawler console and click on **Create Crawler** 

![glue crawler](/img/glue_ui.png)

2. Give a **name** for the Glue Crawler (`my-crawler-1`)

![glue crawler](/img/glue_crawler_1.png)

3. Add the **data source** as S3 bucket where you have your cleansed and processed data (`s3://etl-batch-emr-demo/cleaned_data`)

![glue crawler](/img/glue_crawler_2.png)

4. Attach the **IAM role** (`AWSGlueServiceRole-default`) 

![glue crawler](/img/glue_crawler_3.png)

5. Create a **database** by clicking on **Add database** and select the same from dropdown menu (`my_demo_db`) 

![glue crawler](/img/glue_crawler_4.png)

6. Review and verify all the details and click on **Create crawler** 

![glue crawler](/img/glue_crawler_5.png)

7. Once the crawler is created, select the crawler and click on **Run** 

![glue crawler](/img/glue_run.png)

8. Once the crawler finishes its run, you will see `detected tables`

![glue crawler](/img/glue_run_complete.png)

Now that we have the Glue Data Catalog table created, we can navigate to Amazon Athena to query the data using SQL.

### Querying output data using Amazon Athena standard SQL 

1. Open Athena query editor, you can keep Data Source as the default `AwsDataCatalog` and select `my_demo_db` for Database and run the following query. 

```sql
SELECT * FROM "my_demo_db"."cleaned_data" limit 10;
```

![athena](/img/athena_q1.png)

2. Now, you can perform other SQL queries to analyze the data. For example, if we would like to know the `forcast_monthly_revenue` for each `region per segment wise`, we can run this:

```sql 
SELECT 
    region, 
    segment, 
    SUM(forecasted_monthly_revenue) as forcast_monthly_revenue 
FROM "my_demo_db"."cleaned_data" 
GROUP BY segment, region;

```
